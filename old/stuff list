Geneforge list of stuff to do

=======
Per map
=======

-Be able to scroll around a zone and see relevant objects in a zone
 -See containers on the map and the items inside
  -Group all the items in a single place together
 -See quests (given, rewards, or steps) on a zone
 -Filter items, quests, etc.
  -Have a way to pull 'tagged' things for showing/hiding
 -See the mechanics checks for items on the map
-See conversations possible in a zone
 -Get the conversation data for a zone
  -Parse the dlg.txt files
  -Persist conversation nodes in the data model
 -See the flow for a conversation
  -Link the conversation nodes together
  -
 -See the requirements for triggering a specific conversation step

-See a list of items in the game and where they are obtained
 -Create a list of items with their data
  -Create an item template view
  -Populate a grid with items
 -See how items are obtained
  -Parse relevant item data
   -Monster drops
   -Zone locations
   -Scripts that give items
   -Conversations that give items
   -Shops
  -Create a view when an item is clicked that shows where it is obtained

See quests in the game
 -Parse quest data (name, description) from .exe file
 -Parse quest giving, finishing in scripts
  -Figure out how to determine conditions for these (how are conversation nodes triggered, etc.)

See shops, trainers in the game
 -Parse shop, trainer data (where is it?)
 -Parse shop openers

-conversations
-events
-mines, triggers with mech
-switches with mech
-doors (with mech or related levers/conversation/etc)
-fix items to have their x, y offset stored and used in map generation
-shops

Flags
-from conversation options
-from monsters
-Convert flags to readable text depending on how/where they are set (next to quests, by monster deaths, etc)

=========
Item View
=========

-Item template information
-Item locations:
 -quest rewards
 -Conversation stuff (similar to rewards I guess)
 -monster drops
 -events
 -on ground/in containers

===========
Item Images
===========

-graphic tempalte refers to file (51 -> G1510.bmp)
-which icon refers to ordering (top left is 0 then goes right, then down a row I think?)
 -graphic sheet might refer to the row in the actual file (2 is third from top for example)

-TODO: figure out graphic color adjust (animal skin and fine skin for ex)

=============
Conversations
=============

A big TODO here

====
CSVs
====

-Pull quests, special items from Geneforge 5.exe
-Add functionality to actually generate ability_text csv
 -generate this from gf5objsmisc.txt file ('^ab_')
-Find out how to fully parse item_variety, stat_text instead of hardcoding lists

============
Useful stuff
============

Get all the flag getters in the scripts folder
grep -o 'gf([0-9]\+\,[0-9]\+)\|get_flag([0-9]\+\,[0-9]\+)' *

Get all the places where you need to have specific standing (rebel or shaper)
grep 'gf(100,0)' * > ~/dev/python/geneforge/geneforge5data/influence.txt
